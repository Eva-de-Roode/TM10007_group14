This folder contains the code created for our machine learning project, in which is looked for the best classifier to distinguish malignant from benign for the liver radiomic-features dataset.

"final_assignment.ipynb": contains the code in which the data inspection and feature selection is done, and the classifiers are trained. The results from these classifiers are then plotted in ROC-curves and learning curves.
